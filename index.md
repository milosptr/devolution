  - title: Security
    description: We take security for serious. Usually for many it is not important
      or recognized as priority until disaster or malicious activity happens - then
      it is usually too late to react and damage is made so in that light we are here
      to provide continuous proposals and updates related to security of your infrastructure
      and applications. We use layered approach meaning that we dedicate attention
      to each layer of your stack and make sure that multiple safety nets are implemented.

  subtitle: About Us
  title: We like to build things that matter
  description: |-
    Companies usually need a DevOps person to set up infrastructure and other tooling in the early phases of development and later on the need for active engagement diminishes until some milestone is reached (beta testing, product launch, etc.) Hiring a DevOps can be a long and painful process since there is a shortage of people with these skills on the market, so finding one can be hard (and expensive), also the need for these services may not always be there.

    We recognized this and decided to provide DevOps as a Service, we consider this is the most suitable way of cooperation for a large number of companies, no matter their size. Our team consists of people with vast experience working in the DevOps, SysOps, Networking and VoIP space. During the time we spent working in companies we recognized patterns in software development and applied that knowledge into making frameworks that allow us to quickly provision environments, set up monitoring and all other tooling needed for active development and running software in production.

    We have multiple modes of operation ranging from short-term / one time jobs to long term support. We are very flexible since we know that every customer has a unique set of requirements and it is our job to accommodate them.

    title: Initial meeting
    description: Talking with your team in order to understand your current position
      and goals, getting a rough idea of which technologies and services are being
      used and what the end result should look like.
  - icon: "/images/notebook_perspective_matte.png"
    title: Initial proposal
    description: Based on the notes we make at our first meeting(s), our team comes
      up with a short-term and long-term list of tasks that will get us to the goals
      we defined.
  - icon: "/images/code_perspective_matte_s.png"
    title: Implement
    description: Upon agreeing on the order of tasks and timelines, our team starts
      working on the implementation. During this phase we will have active communication
      with your team, we try to iterate fast and deliver initial versions as soon
      as possible in order to get early feedback and prevent potential misunderstandings.
  - icon: "/images/screenshot_2021-09-30_at_21-17-15-removebg-preview.png"
    title: Present
    description: Upon completing a milestone we present the work that has been done
      to the team, this has the benefit of getting the feedback from people that are
      actually going to use our solutions and also allowing them to better understand
      how things are working. We also tend to write documentation where it is applicable
      so it can serve as a reference in the future.

    title: Repeat
    description: We do work in Implement/Present cycles until the task list is closed.

    title: Long term support and monitoring
    description: "(Optional) When the work that was agreed upon is done, we go into
      long term support mode where our team monitors infrastructure and services,
      proactively reacts to potential issues that are tracked via our Monitoring system
      and provides support for implementing smaller features."
